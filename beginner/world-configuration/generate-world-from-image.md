# Generate World from Image

![Custom world](http://i.imgur.com/b84tZgQ.png)

Take full control over the plugin by telling the plugin to create a world based on an image you give it. Paint every detail of the world. For example, you can make islands, rivers, or even generate a world based on your server logo or a map of the planet itself \(check the example below\).

### Example

### Generate your own image-based world

1. Create a new image in your favorite editor (Photoshop, Gimp, etc). Each pixel of your image will equal 1 in-game block (i.e. a 5000x5000px image will create a 5000x5000 block map). See Take Control below for more details about how to map a biome to a portion of your image. Once you've created your map, save it as a PNG called `map.png` (it must be in the PNG format with this exact name). Upload the image to your server.

2. Enable the feature in the config file of EWG \(located at `*/plugins/EpicWorldGenerator/settings.json` and set`"enableGeneratorSwap":` to `true`

3. Place the map.png image file into the world folder of the world you want to create at  
`*/<world folder>/settings/map.png`

{% hint style="warning" %}
> The file must be named `map.png`
{% endhint %}

> Note: If there is already a world (files in `*/<world folder>/region/`), then you will need to delete them prior to starting the server so EWG can create a new map. This *will* erase your existing world.

4. Start the server

5. [Pre-generate](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/world-configuration/generate-world-from-image) the map (highly recommended)

6. Join the world \(using `/mv teleport` if you use [MultiVerse - core](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core)\)

In the example above. We used this image, named it `map.png` and placed it in the folder;

### Take control

Each biome has its own color property. This property is used to find the biome to match any pixel in the image. You can add multiple colors to each biome using the config files for each biomes. Inside the config file, you will find something like this:

```javascript
  "biomeColors": [
      "#030605",
      "#130605"
   ],
```

Add or change colors here to link the biomes to different colors on the image.

{% hint style="info" %}
> Note that it does pick the biome which has the `"biomeColors"` value that is the closest to the color on the `map.png`
{% endhint %}
