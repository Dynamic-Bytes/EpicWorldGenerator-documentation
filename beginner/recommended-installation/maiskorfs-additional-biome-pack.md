8. Copy everything in this folder and paste it into your server

{% hint style="info" %}
If you already have any of these plugins installed, you don't have to copy the `.jar` file for that plugin. Make sure to **always** replace the EpicWorldGenerator folder in your server, even though it is already in there. This contains the schematics for the world.
{% endhint %}

9. Continue with the [Recommended Installation](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/recommended-installation) or [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.dynamic-bytes.com/beginner/recommended-installation) if you came from either of these. If you did not, remove the `regions` folder which you can find in your `*/<world name>/regions`, and restart the server.
