# Basic installation guide

This is a basic guide for installing the plugin.
If you have any issues with any of the steps in this list, 
make sure to contact support on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Jq3ecb3).

1. Stop your server. 
2. Delete the worlds you want EpicWorldGenerator to generate in. Eg "world".
3. Put the plugin in the plugin folder
4. Start the server and then stop it to generate configuration files
5. Go to the plugin folder to EpicWorldGenerator and add all worlds you do not want EpicWorldGenerator to touch. The section for this in the config file is named "worldsWithDefaultWG". For example if you want to have a vanilla overworld besides the worlds generated by EpicWorldGenerator. EpicWorldGenerator will not touch your Nether, End or flat worlds. It might touch plot worlds, so add them to the config. 
6. Install [Tree Feller](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tree-feller-ewg-addon.20385/)?
7. Start the server and enjoy the plugin!
